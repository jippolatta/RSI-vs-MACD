# RSI-vs-MACD
This project examines the use of an RSI and MACD trading on ETFs. I used Quanstrat/Blotter to compare two simple trading strategies, and then to add a simple optimization to the prevailing strategy. The testing found that an optimized RSI trading strategy outperformed the market for the chosen ETFs over the specified period. The code provides further discussion into the outcomes of the back testing. 

All packages used, with the exception of the INFT361Course package, are free and open for public use. This specific package simply loads the data as XTS data frames and renames them accordingly.

**This project (including all of its code) is not to be used for the basis of a trading strategy. It is a simple comparison project, the results of which may not be accurate. Seek advice from a financial planner before investing.**
